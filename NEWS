Changes in Version 1.3-3:

  o Bug fixes in various bclust routines: stop() if required packages
    are not found
  o svm() now interfaces LIBSVM 2.35 which is a bug fix release.
    A call with invalid parameters now no longer causes R to be
    terminated, and the C(++) code became completely silent.
  o Bugs fixed in fclustIndex function and print.fclust.  
    
Changes in Version 1.3-1:

  o Functions rmvnorm and dmvnorm for multivariate normal
    distributions have been moved to package mvtnorm.

  o Bug fixes in print.fclust and fclustIndex.

  o fixed floyd.c (ANSI C pedantic warnings)

  
Changes in Version 1.2-1:

  o Bug fixes in cmeans.c, cshell.c and scaclust.c (R header files
    included and unused variables removed)
  
  o Bug fixes in Rsvm.c and svm.R (incomplete list of returned Support 
    Vectors).

  o Encapsulate kmeans call in bclust() in a try construct, because
    kmeans gives an error when a cluster becomes empty (which can
    happen for almost every data set from time to time).

    
Changes in Version 1.2-0:

  o Added functions for bagged clustering, see help(bclust).

  o read.pnm() and write.pgm() have been removed from e1071, much
    improved versions can now be found in the new package pixmap. 

  o Lots of documentation updates and bugfixes.

  o Support Vector Machine interface now upgraded to libsvm V. 2.31
    featuring:
    - Multi-Class Classification
    - weighting of classes for C-classification (for asymmetric sample sizes)
    - nu-regression
    - Formula Interface
    - k-fold cross-validation
    In addition, an introductory article is provided in directory
    `docs/' (svmdoc.pdf).

  o classAgreement now features an option to match factor levels

  o updated API design for the fuzzy clustering functions
    (cmeans, cshell, scaclust). Documentation updates and function
    name changes (cmeanscl -> cmeans, validity.measures -> fclustIndex)
